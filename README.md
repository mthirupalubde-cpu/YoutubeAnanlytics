# YouTube Analytics Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using YouTube API v3, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, SQL Database, and Microsoft Fabric.
Data is ingested from YouTube API, processed with Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold) in Databricks, and finally visualized in Fabric Power BI reports.

ðŸ”¹ Data Ingestion

Collected data using YouTube Data API v3 (Channel: T-Series).
Stored raw JSON/CSV files in Azure Blob Storage (Bronze layer).
Ingested data includes video details, statistics (views, likes, comments), and publishing dates.

ðŸ”¹ Data Transformation (Databricks)

Implemented Medallion Architecture:
Bronze: Raw ingested data.
Silver: Cleaned and deduplicated data.
Gold: Aggregated and transformed data for analysis.

Applied PySpark transformations:
Filtering unnecessary or incomplete data.
Deduplication and error handling.
Calculating metrics like top trending videos, engagement ratios, and average views per day.
Created feature tables ready for analytics and reporting.

ðŸ”¹ Data Movement

Used Azure Data Factory (ADF) to copy Gold tables from Databricks â†’ Azure SQL Database.
Scheduled pipelines for incremental loading to keep the SQL DB up-to-date.

ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling

Built Fabric Semantic Model on top of SQL DB Gold tables.
Applied final cleaning and transformations to prepare datasets for reporting.
Defined measures and dimensions such as:
Total views, likes, comments
Engagement per video
Publishing trends over time

ðŸ”¹ Visualization

Created Power BI reports in Microsoft Fabric:
YouTube engagement distribution by published date, likes, comments, views.
Top trending videos dashboard.
Audience engagement insights (likes-to-views ratio, comment-to-view ratio).
Enabled interactive filters and visualizations for dynamic analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

Successfully built a scalable ETL pipeline from API ingestion to business reporting.
Leveraged PySpark for large-scale data transformations.
Demonstrated Medallion Architecture best practices in Databricks.
Gained actionable insights on YouTube channel performance.
