# YouTube Analytics Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using YouTube API v3, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, SQL Database, and Microsoft Fabric.
Data is ingested from YouTube API, processed with Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold) in Databricks, and finally visualized in Fabric Power BI reports.

Created Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layers

Cleaned and deduplicated data using PySpark

Applied transformations: filtering, aggregations, top 3 trending videos, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Data Movement

Used ADF Copy Activity to move Gold tables â†’ Azure SQL DB

ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling

Built Fabric Semantic Model on top of SQL DB Gold tables

Performed final cleaning for reporting

ðŸ”¹ Visualization

Created reports in Fabric Power BI (example: YouTube engagement distribution by published date, likes, comments, views, etc.)
